I really do. I&#39;ve been on for quite a while now, almost a year, and have made almost 3,000 edits. I know what is OK and what isn&#39;t OK for the most part, and I have tons of Wiki formatting memorized. I have contributed to some really big discussions. I am really good at cleaning up pages that don&#39;t fit S:GUIDES, especially grammar and sounding professional. I&#39;ve been top contributor of the month quite a few times, and I have a nice sense of wiki humor. Overall, I spend 70% of my free time on the wiki, look at almost as many account requests as jvvg, and would love being one of the administrators. I could help by keeping the Community Portal under control size-wise, do some stuff that people brought up a long time ago but never got around to doing, and keeping everybody in line. I haven&#39;t made any major programming </span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.8occ02f344le"><span class="c3">ErnieParke</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">I have helped update the Wiki to Scratch 2.0, and I am knowledgable in the Wiki and formatting.

I also am the top contributor of the month right now, though other then that, go Scratch Wiki!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5 c22" id="h.tdfxyzvnvfs6"><span class="c3"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.6dv3wieiqpve"><span class="c3">Hardmath123 </span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve been on Scratch for 4 years now and have spent over half that time on the Wiki&mdash;so I know a lot about Scratch culture and Scratch history (I was there for most of it!).

Most people consider me responsible (in fact, I was nominated for admin by scimonster a while ago; I was also a curator which shows that the Scratch Team trusts me). I am particularly obsessive about quality, grammar, etc., and I am extremely active (I have edited far more than most admins).

On this wiki, I am very active (and on Scratch) and have contributed very much to the block pages in the TOC, and upgraded most of them to Scratch 2.0, as well as changed much TOC coding.

I have 6000 edits, and have been on the wiki for 2 years and 1 month. I have lots of experience with the wiki, such as creating a bot (VoxBot) which cleans up spelling and other wiki mistakes, making conclusive articles (notably Scratch Wiki:Bots and S:EW), adding to existing pages (notably Scratch Wiki:Group Rights and template documentations), use wiki markup (Help:CSS and Scratch Wiki:Group Rights) and help new users with the wiki. I also have made some patience-requiring edits, such as a manual category moving of &gt; 200 files and a linking of block to blocks (&gt;50 pages). As an EW, I plan to accept accounts carefully and assist rejected accounts, patrol edits with the patrol tool to keep the wiki free of grammar mistakes, and fix pages without using my bot. I know I can be good at these simply tasks because I go on the wiki afterschool or 3-6 hours on the wiki, which makes me one of the top month editors. Also, my dedication to the wiki will help me be super active on the wiki and keep on top of requests! Thank you and good luck everyone! ;)</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.8pc0d7m0u2zj"><span class="c3">Turkey3 </span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hey! It&#39;s turkey3 here. Not quite sure where to start. I have a pretty good idea on why I should be elected for EW. For one thing, I have been on this Wiki actively about a year and a half (though my account is older) so I understand very well the works and such. Last year when I ran I definitely did not have a good understanding of programming outside of Scratch, but now after one year I am fluent in HTML, CSS, and JS and run a web hosting business. I think I write very professional articles. Being an EW would mean a lot as I get to help jvvg and others with account requests and get off the couch (and to a chair). Other than that I don&#39;t know what to say, other than good luck to everybody else! I think you all know me well enough, as my duties here cannot be summed up in one paragraph.</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.wofy42mx0fxk"><span class="c10"></span></h2><h2 class="c2" id="h.91awyuqv1xwr"><span class="c10"></span></h2><p class="c12 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.ucrnr87dc5je"><span class="c10">Losing Speeches:</span></h2><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.6vk0509hnmn5"><span class="c3">-PRO- </span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">I have been of Scratch for a little over a year now.

It&#39;s so much fun to edit, is very enjoyable, has such a great community, and has practically everything you need to know about Scratch so far. I&#39;ve been on this Wiki for about 5 months with 2000+ edits, but I&#39;m also very experienced here despite my time being here not being as long as some others. I know tons of Wiki code, have been an active member here for so long, I&#39;ve made some articles, and I make lots of constructive edits. I think I would be good at some of the repetitive tasks here, such as deleting unused files that haven&#39;t ever been used, patrolling some edits, and accepting account requests. Why would I be good at those? Because I&#39;ve shown patience and being able to look through many things on this website before. I&#39;ve had experience with that as an SDS curator, where you look through tons of submissions, and being a curator, where you look through tons of project submissions. So, I&#39;ve shown good skills with things like that in the past. Thanks for reading, and good luck to everyone in this election!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.tm0qvemhziar"><span class="c21">February 2016</span></h1><h2 class="c15" id="h.4jdui5h301xr"><span class="c10">Winning Speeches:</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.evp766xzzcbc"><span class="c3">&nbsp;st19_galla &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">I believe that the Scratch Wiki is a wonderful place for anyone to learn more about a wide variety of topics. I&#39;m so grateful that I get to be here editing alongside you guys. However, I also feel that the wiki could use some valuable improvements. With contributions ranging from creating and editing many pages, I hope that you&#39;ll see me as an Experienced Wikian who will help approve account requests, keep the Wiki from being vandalized, and ensuring that it continues to be an amazing place for Scratchers to go for learning. I have experience doing the tedious work from being an SDS Curator and will approve account requests very quickly and efficiently. I pledge to be extremely active, easy-to-reach, connected to the main site (for updating the News Section and various articles), and the best EW I can be. Thank you for all of your contributions to the Scratch Wiki and for considering me to be one of the elected EWs.

I try to make sure that all of my edits really do make the Wiki a better place. In the time I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve made many new pages and expanded countless others, I often make redirects, fix grammar, add interwiki links and upload images, I also enjoy welcoming new users to the Wiki, and I&#39;m always happy to answer their questions. I know lots of wiki code, HTML and CSS, which is helpful for templates. I want to be an EW so I have the powers needed to do things without having to ask an admin, such as deleting pages which go against the guidelines. I&#39;m very active here on the wiki, which means that I could quickly update the news as soon as it comes out, I also constantly check recent changes, and I always try to fix things when needed. I also think I&#39;d be great at reviewing account requests, as I&#39;ve had the same kind-of role as Front Page Curator, an SDS curator and a Welcoming Committee Curator, where I&#39;ve shown patience, and I&#39;ve used my judgement to review projects, similar to reviewing account requests. Thanks for reading, and good luck to all!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.ow8i379dya3q"><span class="c10">Losing Speeches:</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.n5z1c3bvpe4q"><span class="c3">&nbsp;The_Grits</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &mdash;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hey everybody! I&rsquo;m The_Grits, and I&rsquo;ve been on the Wiki for just over a year. I have nearly 3 years of experience in web development and am very familiar with markup, experience that helps me a lot when I edit the Wiki. I tend to help out in the Wiki by discussing issues in the Community Portal, expanding stubs so that they can be unstubbed, or by simply fixing the grammatical and factual errors I come across in the Wiki. The Wiki is an important learning resource for Scratchers of all stages, a resource that needs to be kept up-to-date and accurate. This is why I would like to help the community even more by becoming an Experienced Wikian. Thank you for your consideration! - The_Grits</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.boklgcevbdf6"><span class="c3">&nbsp;PrincessPandaLover</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Hello all fellow &quot;Scratch Wikians&quot;, it&#39;s me, PrincessPandaLover! Since September 2014, I have been making very essential and helpful edits to all the mainspace articles, such as adding references, pictures, and important content (wow, almost made 2,500 edits); oh, and also removing unneeded content and creating several articles and redirects. I&#39;m very sweet and gentle, welcoming new scratchers and supporting users whenever they&#39;re in trouble. Everyday, I pop up onto the wiki, review the recent changes, and do whatever needs to be done. Whenever an interesting discussion pops up, I immediately join into the conversation and start chatting about what needs to be done. Scratching since June 2013, I have a decent amount of Scratch knowledge and will not hesitate to share my methods and skills. I hope you&#39;ll vote for me and gladly congratulate me for joining in this year&#39;s election, stay Sonic!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.l1idg3gcrqda"><span class="c3">&nbsp;purplebook163 </span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">I would make a great EW because I would be able to deeply disect account requests and wisely decide wether or not the person applying is a good pick for a Wiki Editor. Though I haven&#39;t made as many edits as others, I&#39;m still a good writer. Like the Wiki is always saying, it&#39;s not the number of edits that matter, it&#39;s the quality. I like to sit down and hit the &quot;Random&quot; button on the wiki and correct as many errors as I can find; these are the kind of quality edits I make. While I haven&#39;t been very active as of late, I will be very active soon. I will be able to focus a great amount of my energy into the Wiki. I look forward to the chance of being able to quickly and efficently take care of the needs of this Wiki, such as deleting pages, updating the news, and confirming accounts. Thank you for this great opportunity!</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.46wntuq2o98"><span class="c21">June 2017</span></h1><h2 class="c15" id="h.b6b2wdy6q0pm"><span class="c10">Winning Speeches:</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.vpfqljlk2xbu"><span class="c3">&nbsp;Customhacker</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &mdash;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Heya! I&#39;m Customhacker. I&rsquo;m familiar with the community; using Scratch for almost 3 years, and spending 1 year in the Forums. I joined the Wiki some time ago, and I&rsquo;ve seen it grow and change. Through my time in both communities, I know what we need: Leadership - which I can not only provide, but handle properly. The Wiki needs more organization. I&rsquo;ve seen multiple Wikians join who would like to be active and helpful - but can&#39;t, as we left them to figure everything out! Users get S:NEW and S:CHEAT in their welcome message which isn&#39;t enough. I hate seeing users floundering, as they aren&#39;t able to reply to others. That&rsquo;s the most basic thing on the Wiki - but users aren&rsquo;t taught how to do it! This needs to change. I&rsquo;m the person who can start this revolution of the Wiki, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to do it. Vote Customhacker for EW!</span></p><p class="c12 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.cyo9ssfh6n49"><span class="c3">&nbsp;makethebrainhappy </span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Hello Scratch Wiki Members, my name is MakeTheBrainHappy and I hope to be your next EW. As an EW, I will continue to look for ways to help connect the main site to the wiki by supporting wiki Wednesday and receiving community feedback on what should be added to the wiki. By sparking interest in the wiki I will support activity growth and encourage new users to join us :). Personally I have written six stickied guides in the forums and many more ITopics. On the wiki I have been active over these past two years adding edits, paragraphs, and references to improve the wiki and it&#39;s culture. I have served in many leadership capacities in the scratch community, and I feel that I would serve well in the capacity of experienced wikian.

In the time I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve revamped some pages, fixed countless language errors, and made quite a few new pages. Oh, don&#39;t forget welcoming people! I really think that new users don&#39;t get the love they deserve; they&#39;re mostly ignored. I have been remedying that, both by answering questions and proactively offering help. Though I live on the other side of the world, I promise that for the rest of my programming life, I will be unswervingly active, immediately reachable, and inseparable from the main site, whether I win or not.

I also see a lot of pages not related to Scratch, or have the necessity to be deleted in which case being an EW would help the issue. I also consider myself good at reviewing things, therefore I would consider myself well at reviewing account requests.

Over the course of this speech, I will tell you why I personally think I&rsquo;d be a good Experienced Wikian for our wiki. One reason is because I&rsquo;ve worked in multiple different collaborations on the Scratch site (There isn&rsquo;t just one EW on the Scratch wiki; there&rsquo;s a team of different Wikians, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m mentioning collaborations). Also, if I became an EW, I believe I would try my best to keep the wiki going, and keep it efficient.

Answer: since I&#39;m already helping so much with administration on the interwikis, why should this wiki be left out? Additionally, I&#39;m hugely active on the English Scratch Wiki, as you all can see. As an EW, I would have many new capabilities for improving the wiki, like confirming accounts.
